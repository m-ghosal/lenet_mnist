# An MNIST Classifier using LeNet-5 architecture
## In this project, I trained an MNIST Classifier using a LeNet model. The steps I followed to complete this project are as follows:##
* Familiarized myself with the MNIST database, and went through some of the 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images
* Researched thoroughly about the LeNet structure, and how to code LeCun's model efficiently
* Researched about how to load and customize training and validation datasets and about how to train and validate a CNN
* Downloaded the necessary libraries (PyTorch, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit, Pandas, Numpy)
* Coded and trained the model
* Plotted accuracy and loss graphs for the trained model
* Plotted confusion matrix to better understand the accuracy of trained model's predictions
* Researched about and then coded the visualizations for certain layers

## How to run the project ##
The code (a .py file) can be run through the built-in terminal in macOS, given that all the libraries are installed
The slideshow can be accessed by downloading the pdf of the slides
